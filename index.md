Hi, I'm shine.

I'm a person who loves the web. I try to make the web better in the little ways I can.
I volunteered for mozilla very actively for a while (during my college days) and then due to time constraints, I had to become a passive contributor later (after I started working full-time).
I develop for the web with web technologies. I'll post my experiments with the web here.
