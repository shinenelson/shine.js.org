I've _played_ around with HTML, CSS extensively before,
but I haven't really put my hand deep into the JavaScript
jar before.

Well, if you don't know what JavaScript is yet, I'm going
to act really surprised at first and then straighten up
and just plainly disbelieve you. Anyway, I'll still give
you a quick introduction :

> JavaScript is what powers the internet.

If you're going to claim that you don't know what the internet
is, I'm going to just simply ignore you. I'll just say that
that's where you're at right now.

So, let's get back to JavaScript. JavaScript is pretty much
on any website on the internet in some form or the other.
If nothing, it's in your browser for sure.

The world has leaped many bounds since the time when it only
ran inside a container inside the browser. It started with
the client-side ( browsers ) but it has now evolved into
running on the server-side as well. So, one could assume that
JavaScript has _invaded_ pretty much all of the internet.

I've enjoyed following the technology - how it evolved into
what it is today. And I like the direction it is going too.
To clarify, when I said that JavaScript has invaded the
internet, I meant it in a good way. JavaScript is already
in your browsers. That's how it has been since the beginning
of the internet. I don't see that changing in the short-term[^1],
so, if JavaScript is already in your browser, then why do we
need another programming language to develop for the web?
That's my rationale for believing that the web doesn't need
another programming language. Other programming languages
might have their own place elsewhere, and I have views on
that too but I believe that the web doesn't need another
programming language than JavaScript.

While I've had my fair share of dealing with JavaScript
applications ( both in good and bad ways ), most of my
experience has been from the sidelines. I haven't really
gotten too involved in terms of actually writing "**code**"
in JavaScript.

Today, someone posed this question to me :

> Are you going to continue claiming ignorance with JavaScript?

I don't want to get into the details of the conversation,
but that question made me ponder, "am I really claiming
ignorance with JavaScript?" While the first answer was "No",
I realized maybe I was actually _claiming ignorance_. I still
don't consider myself a programmer, but I thought maybe it
wouldn't hurt to give it a shot. Considering the evolution
of the technology, I don't think it would be a bad idea to
pick up a little bit on JavaScript.

So, that's what I'm going to do - give JavaScript ( or the
underlying programming specification - ECMAScript ) a shot.
