Hi, I'm shine.

I'm a person who loves the web. I try to make the web better in the little ways I can.

I [volunteered for mozilla](https://mozillians.org/u/shine) very actively for a while (during my college days) and then due to time constraints, I had to become a passive contributor later (after I started working full-time).

I was involved in the forming the mozilla community in my region - [Mozilla Kerala](https://github.com/mozillakerala) back in 2013.
We organized many events :
* [WebMaker Malabar (WMM)](http://events.mozillakerala.org/wmm)
* Maker Party Kochi
* Empower WoMoz
* [HackrGirls](http://hackrgirls.womoz.in)
* WoMoz Bootcamp
* [Coffee Meetups](http://blog.mozillakerala.org/tag/mozcoffee/)
* Community Meetups - 2013, 2014, 2015

Read more about our activites on the [Mozilla Kerala Blog](http://blog.mozillakerala.org) | [posts by shine](http://blog.mozillakerala.org/author/shine).

Here are some more projects I've played around with [impress.js](https://github.com/impress/impress.js) built by [**@bartaz**](https://github.com/bartaz) :
* [Unicorn](https://shinenelson.github.io/unicorn) - Seminar presentation for college
* [Hacking & Hacker Culture](https://shinenelson.github.io/Hacking-Hacker-Culture) : another presentation for a talk I gave at AngelHack Kochi 2013
* [FOSS & Mozilla](https://shinenelson.github.io/FOSS-Mozilla) - My story with FOSS & Mozilla
